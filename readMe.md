## Project Title
Social Rewards for Creating Viral Content

## Project Description
The "Social Rewards for Creating Viral Content" project incentivizes users to create and share high-quality, engaging content. Content creators earn rewards in the form of tokens or ETH based on the number of likes their posts receive. The smart contract ensures fair distribution of rewards and transparency by using the Ethereum blockchain. Users can create posts, like content, and withdraw their earned rewards directly through the decentralized application.

## Contract Address
**Contract Address** : 0x049E19AFdE58C15e90671bF82093a69aF712bBB4

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to establish a decentralized social platform where content creators are directly rewarded for the engagement they generate. By using blockchain technology, the project eliminates intermediaries, ensures transparency, and creates a fair ecosystem for rewarding creative individuals. The goal is to promote creativity and innovation while providing an equitable reward structure for contributors.

## Key Features

- **Post Creation**: Users can create posts that are publicly stored and managed by the smart contract.
- **Like Functionality**: Posts can receive likes from other users, which contributes to the creator’s reward.
- **Reward System**: Creators are rewarded based on the number of likes their posts receive, with tokens or ETH distributed automatically.
- **Fund Contract**: The contract owner can fund the smart contract with ETH to ensure sufficient liquidity for rewards.
- **Withdraw Rewards**: Content creators can withdraw their earned rewards directly to their wallets.
- **Transparency and Decentralization**: All transactions and reward distributions are handled transparently on the blockchain, ensuring trust and security.

## How It Works
1. **Create a Post**: Users interact with the smart contract to create a new post.
2. **Engagement**: Other users can like posts, increasing the creator’s engagement metrics.
3. **Reward Distribution**: The contract owner reviews posts and distributes rewards to creators based on the number of likes.
4. **Withdraw Funds**: Creators can withdraw their earned rewards whenever they like.

### Example Use Case
- Alice creates a post using the platform.  
- Bob and other users like Alice’s post, increasing the engagement metrics.
